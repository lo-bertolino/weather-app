# weather-app
My own weather app, written by me from the ground up.
At the moment I have no idea where this will take me :)
I know I'll write it in Swift, because I want to get better at that and because I want to be able to use it when it's done.
I'll try to integrate as many good practices I can into the development, CI, Testing and whatnot
